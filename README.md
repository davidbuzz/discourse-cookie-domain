discourse-cookie-domain
=======================

A Discourse plugin to add an additional cookie at the second-level domain, for site/s wanting to do cross-site credential management.

This essentially allows an install at forums.example.com to create a cookie that is valid at www.example.com AND example.com 

This is derived from the work by ntauthority, from where it is forked.

See [Discourse Meta](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-as-the-sso-provider/19139/5) for more information.
